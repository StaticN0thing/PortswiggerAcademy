# Lab: 2FA bypass using a brute-force attack
### https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-bypass-using-a-brute-force-attack

Replace the lab_id at the top of mfa.py with your current lab_id (0a3c00fe040ea29fc00009fa0...)

Then Run mfa.py: 

````
python3 mfa.py
````

The code is usually between 1000 and 2000. When the script finds a match it will exit and display the code:

````
...
1290
1309
Error:1309
MFA Code:1309
````

Thats it
